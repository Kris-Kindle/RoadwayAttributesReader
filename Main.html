<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Marijuana has become a very popular topic in recent years. This year, nine different states have an initiative on the ballot relating to some form of marijuana. Four of these states are looking to legalize the recreational use while the remaining five states are either looking to implement a Medical Marijuana Law or increase the scope of their current Medical Marijuana Law (as is the case in Montana). Naturally there are those that oppose the legalization of marijuana in both the medical or recreational form. One of the opponents’ biggest platforms is the increased danger to public safety that individuals who drive while under the influence of marijuana pose. In this paper we aim to determine whether this concern is well founded. We will examine the relationship between the rate of fatalities due to car accidents and the advent of Medical Marijuana Laws.<br />
To examine this relationship we will first perform a review of the relevant current literature to better understand the problem and its context. We will then use the insight that we have gained from reviewing the literature to collect data for the creation of a model. We will attempt to create a model to describe the effect that implementation of a Medical Marijuana Law has on the rate of fatalities due to car accidents.</p>
<h2 id="cannabis">Cannabis</h2>
<p>There are those that believe we will not be able to determine the effects of the recent trend in liberalization of marijuana policies for another decade. <span class="citation"></span>. We do not believe this to be the case as California has had a Medical Marijuana Law for almost 20 years now. We believe that this is sufficient time for the effect to present itself.<br />
Opponents to medical marijuana also contend that the adoption of a Medical Marijuana Law will cause an increase in youth use of marijuana. Studies have shown that this is not necessarily the case. In their 2012 study Anderson et. al found that was no statistically significant change in the rate of youth consumption due to a Medical Marijuana Law. <span class="citation"></span><br />
Outside the scope of this study but interesting still is the research that is being conducted on the effect that legalization of recreational marijuana has on society. Many researchers view these liberalized marijuana policies as a grand natural experiment and are tracking the effects of that these policies may have on the use rate of marijuana and the danger that might come from an increase in the use rate <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<h3 id="cannabis-and-cannabinoids">Cannabis and Cannabinoids</h3>
<p>What we know as marijauna is the leaves and buds of two of the three species of the genus Cannabis. The species Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica are the two species that are cultivated for their buds and leaves to be used as an intoxicant. The third species of Cannabis, Cannabis ruderalis does not contain significant levels of the chemical compounds that produce the intoxicating effect associated with the consumption of marijuana. Cannabis ruderalis is primarily grown for the fiber and seeds that it produces with both of these products being referred to as hemp products <span class="citation"></span>.<br />
The psychoactive component present in significant levels in the species Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC belongs to a class of compounds named after the genus Cannabis, Cannabinoids. Marijuana contains a number of other Cannabiniods beyond THC with the most notable of these other Cannabinoids being Cannabidiol (CBD).</p>
<h3 id="therapeutic-uses-of-marijuana">Therapeutic Uses of Marijuana</h3>
<p>At the heart of Medical Marijuana Laws is the fact that marijuana has been established as a viable therapeutic remedy for some medical conditions. Even with marijuana’s classification as a Schedule 1 controlled substance there have been studies conducted in the efficacy of marijuana as therapeutic remedy. The main class of chemical compounds that are of interest in marijuana is the class Cannabinoid. Of the many Cannabinoids that marijuana is composed of there are two main compounds that have been the focus of the research into the efficacy of marijuana as a therapeutic remedy. These two compounds are THC and CBD. We will detail some of the medical conditions that marijuana or one of its derivatives that have been proven to be an effective therapeutic remedy.<br />
It should be noted that studies into the efficacy of marijuana as an effective therapeutic remedy are much less common than studies on the synthetic versions of the Cannabinoids THC and CBD. This can be attributed to the Schedule 1 controlled substance status of marijuana.</p>
<h4 id="aids-wasting">AIDS Wasting</h4>
<p>THC has been proven effective in the treatment of AIDS wasting. AIDS wasting is when patients involuntarily loose a significant portion of bodyweight (usually around 10% ) due to the onset of AIDS. The reason that THC is an effective treatment is because it is an appetite stimulant and performs as an anti-nausea remedy. <span class="citation"></span></p>
<h4 id="glaucoma">Glaucoma</h4>
<p>THC is generally accepted as the most effective treatment for the relieving of the pressure placed on the ocular from Glaucoma. The most common form of THC that is used in the treatment of Glaucoma is THC drops that patients place right on their eye. <span class="citation"></span></p>
<h4 id="multiple-sclerosis">Multiple Sclerosis</h4>
<p>THC in a variety of forms has proven to be effective at reducing the muscle spasm caused by Multiple Sclerosis. <span class="citation"></span></p>
<h3 id="cannabis-and-driving">Cannabis and Driving</h3>
<p>When we begin to discuss the effect that medical marijuana has on the number of fatal accidents in the states that have legalized its use, one of the first topics that comes up is the effect that the use of marijuana has on an individual’s ability to operate a motor vehicle. The inebriating effect that marijuana has is one of the main reasons that it is consumed recreationally. There are many individuals who will chose to consume it even if it is not legal to possess or consume it in the state that they reside. This willingness to take part in the procurement and consumption of a controlled substance may be indicative of an individual that makes more risky decisions than average We will discuss the ramifications of this later on in the paper, for now we will discuss the effect that this inebriation has on the driving ability of users.<br />
To help determine whether there truly is a relationship between the legalization of medical marijuana and the rate of fatal car accidents we will look at the effect that the consumption of marijuana has on the user’s driving capabilities. One of the earliest studies that we could find to describe the effect that THC has psychomotor skills was the meta study conducted by Berghaus. In the paper they attempt to tease out a time based function of intoxication due to THC. One of their most interesting observations is that individuals that are intoxicated with THC tend to overestimate their level of impairment. This has been echoed by many subsequent studies. <span class="citation"></span> In their 2004 landscape paper Kelly et al looked at the research regarding the effect that the use of various controlled substances had on the user’s driving capabilities. The main psychoactive chemical present in marijuana is THC and a majority of the studies focus their research on the effect that this particular chemical has on the driving capabilities of users. Regarding the effect of THC on driving capability they found that laboratory results showed, “impairments have been detected in tracking, attention, reaction time, short-term memory, hand - eye coordination, vigilance, time and distance perception, decision making and concentration” <span class="citation"></span> . All of these skills that are impaired are necessary in the operation of a motor vehicle and taken alone they can lead to an increase in the probability that the impaired driver will get into an accident. This is not to say that drivers under the influence of THC are any more dangerous than those under the influence of other intoxicating chemicals, such as alcohol. According to Kelly et al drivers that are under the influence of THC are more likely to be aware that they are under the influence and compensate for their diminished driving capabilities by going slower and avoiding difficult driving maneuvers. <span class="citation"></span> The conclusion that they came to regarding the effect that marijuana, and THC in particular is that more research was necessary to determine whether there was a real effect on the driving capability. They cite contradictory results between the real world testing and laboratory testing as the reason for this conclusion.<br />
In their 2011 paper by Li et al performs a meta-analysis of the risk associated with the driving while under the influence of marijuana. The authors of the paper cite the legalization of medical marijuana by 16 states and the District of Columbia as well as the fact that “marijuana is the most commonly detected non alcohol drug in drivers”,as motivation for the study <span class="citation"></span>. In their conclusions the authors determined that there was an increase in the risk of being involved in a motor vehicle accident with the use of marijuana, but that more research was necessary to determine a more precise understanding into the factors of marijuana use that are affecting the increase in motor vehicle accident risk.<br />
With alcohol and marijuana being the two most commonly drugs detected in drivers the next question that one may wonder about is the effect that the combination of alcohol and marijuana would have one the driving ability of users of both substances. This is exactly what Sewell et al set out to determine in their 2009 paper. In this paper Sewell et al performed a comprehensive review of the literature concerning the effect that alcohol and marijuana in tandem had on the driving ability of users. In their conclusion the authors determine that there is a greatly increased chance for drivers under the influence of both alcohol and marijuana to be involved in motor vehicle accidents. They attribute this increase in moving vehicle accident risk to the driver’s inability to use compensatory maneuvers, which they attribute to the consumption of alcohol <span class="citation"></span>.<br />
There has also been research conducted to determine if there is difference in THC intoxication between the sexes. In their study Anderson et al set up a randomized double blind study on the effect that THC intoxication has on the driving ability on both of the sexes. They find that there is no difference in the reduction of critical driving skills due to THC among the sexes. <span class="citation"></span><br />
In states where marijuana is legal to use either for medical or recreational purposes it is often explicitly forbidden to consume marijuana in public. So if marijuana is a substitute for alcohol as suggested by Anderson et al <span class="citation"></span> then it would make sense if more marijuana uses stayed home and consumed marijuana. Part of the concern with the use of marijuana is that there is not a standardized sobriety field test as there is with alcohol. This can make it difficult for law enforcement officers to determine the level of impairment of a driver. Armentano advocates for a two pronged approach to the problem. First increase the public education initiatives concerning the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of marijuana, and second is to increase the required training for officers making field stops to include better awareness of inebriation. <span class="citation"></span></p>
<h3 id="a-look-at-medical-marijuana-laws">A look at Medical Marijuana Laws</h3>
<p>“Medical” marijuana is a bit of a misnomer as marijuana is not considered to be a medicine by the FDA and many speculate that it never will. The reason that they believe that it will never be recognized by the FDA as a medicine is due in part to two things: the natural variation in the chemical composition of cannabis plants and the fact the most popular method of delivery is to inhale the smoke created by burning the dried buds of the cannabis plant. When we talk about what it means for something to be a medicine, one of the most common restrictions is the ability to control the precise amount of a specific chemical compound found in the medicine. Since it is difficult to guarantee the precise ratio and content of chemical compounds in plants it is often the case that the desired chemical compounds are distilled or synthesized to ensure the precise ratio and content. The FDA (Federal Drug Administration) has approved synthetic versions of the active compounds in marijuana for medical use. Dronabinol is a synthetic version of THC and is marketed under the name Marinol and it is an example of a synthetic cannabinoid that has been approved for medicinal use by the FDA. Since the inhalation of any type of smoke is associated with an increase in the risk of many different types of cancer, most notably lung cancer, it is not very likely that this delivery method for cannabinoids will ever be approved for use as a medicine.<br />
The use of medical marijuana containing THC as an active ingredient has been legalized by 24 states in the US. We make the distinction here of THC content because it is the psychoactive chemical that is associated with marijuana. THC is classified as a Cannabinoid. Cannabinoids are a class of chemicals often associated with Cannabis. In fact, many different cannabinoids can be found in the plants of the Cannabis species, not just THC. Another chemical of the class cannabinoid that we would like to highlight is Cannabidiol (CBD). While it may not be legal to grow Cannabis of any species, it is legal to purchase and consume products that contain the cannabinoid CBD (Cannabidiol). CBD can be found in products such as hemp oil.<br />
In the following sections we will take a look at the medical marijuana laws from the states that we collected data for and that have a law allowing the use of THC as an alternative medicine. For the purpose of this study we will ignore states that we have insufficient data for in this way we can compare the same variables for each state. This data may be insufficient due to the fact that even though the state has passed a law allowing the use of medical marijuana it has not implemented a system to allow patients to gain access to medicinal marijuana. One example of this was Maryland, where, as of the writing of this study, has not allowed patients access to medicinal marijuana. We will also exclude from our discussion on the state laws, states that have allowed the use of CBD and not THC. This is due to to CBD not being a psychoactive. We will examine the medical marijuana laws in a chronological order. This is to highlight some of the common themes that get borrowed by each subsequent law to be passed.</p>
<h3 id="federal-law-versus-state-laws">Federal Law versus State Laws</h3>
<p>While individual states may have adopted laws allowing for the use of marijuana as a therapeutic remedy, according to the federal government marijuana is still classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) defines a Schedule 1 drug as follows “Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse”. This obviously necessarily conflicts with a Medical Marijuana Law as per the definition the DEA does not view marijuana as having any accepted medical use. This has caused some tension between the DEA and states that have a working Medical Marijuana Law, in particular states that have established a dispensary system.<br />
A number of states have established a dispensary system most notable among the early adopters was California. These dispensaries have been the focus of federal raids in the past as the federal government.</p>
<h1 id="data-sources">Data Sources</h1>
<p>To determine if there is a causal relationship between the presence of a Medical Marijuana Law and we need to collect data that could explain the rate of car accident fatalities as well as the permissiveness in attitude towards the use of medical marijuana. In this section we will describe the variables that were collected and where the variables were collected from. Included in our description is an overview of how we cleaned the data that we collected from the various sources.</p>
<h2 id="number-of-car-accident-fatalaties">Number of Car Accident Fatalaties </h2>
<p>Since the purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the number of car accident fatalities and the advent of a Medical Marijuana Law it is imperative for us to collect the number of number of fatalities due to car accidents. The source of this data was the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) maintained by the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA). FARS is a database of fatal car accidents which has historical data beginning with the year 1975.<br />
What we collected was the number of car accident fatalities for a given year broken down by state with the number of fatalities for Washington D.C. included in the count. This data was collected in the form of Excel formatted files and R programs were created to join the data into our dataset. This data was collected under the column variable FATAL. The data can be found at the following link.<br />
<a href="http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/States/StatesCrashesAndAllVictims.aspx" class="uri">http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/States/StatesCrashesAndAllVictims.aspx</a></p>
<h2 id="population-estimates">Population Estimates</h2>
<p>It would be really easy to declare that the states with the most number of fatalities due to car accidents present the largest danger for drivers to drive in. This would be a overly simplified way to anoint states as the most dangerous. What we want to do is to be able to normalize the variables for all states so that we can truly determine the inherent danger that each state poses to drivers. One of the variables that we wish to collect for the purpose of normalization is the population of each state.<br />
What we collected was the estimate of the population of a given state for individual years for the entirety of the panel. These estimates included the total population for the state as well as the breakdown of the population estimates by years of age. Beginning with the year – population estimates were broken down into single years of age for residents from newborns to residents aged 79 years with one final group encompassing residents aged 80 years or greater. The data for these particular variables was collected from the United States Census by way of the American Fact Finder web interface.</p>
<h3 id="rates-of-involvement-in-fatal-accidents">Rates of Involvement in Fatal Accidents</h3>
<p>What we would like to collect here is how drivers of different age groups have different rates of involvement in fatal car accidents. we collected this data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI). HLDI collected data from FARS and publishes it on their website.<br />
The data was collected from the HLDI website and placed in a csv format. The collected data included the national rate of involvement in fatal accidents by age group. This data was collected for the entirety of the panel. The data was captured in a series of column variables that shared a similar format Age(AgeGroup)AccidentRate. The data can be found at the following link.<br />

<h2 id="roadway-estimates">Roadway Estimates</h2>
<p>Of vital importance to any study conducted examining the effect of some factor on the risk of driving on our public roadways is information about our public roadways. The number fatalities due to car accidents that we collected data for were of drivers and passengers from our public roadways. We collected information about our public roadways that we believe provide insight into the underlying cause of car accidents.</p>
<h3 id="centerline-miles">Centerline Miles</h3>
<p>This is the straight measure of the number of road miles that exist within a given state. This data was collected from the Federal Highway Administration which is under the Department of Transportation. The Federal Highway Administration publishes a series entitled <em>Highway Statistics Series</em>. This series provides yearly estimates of many different variables relating to our public roadways and it was from this series that we collected the data for centerline miles.There are many table that are included in the yearly entry in the <em>Highway Statistics Series</em>, but the one that we collected the centerline mile data from was the table HM20. This table can be downloaded in a few different file formats including PDF and Excel formats. The file type that we chose to make use of was the Excel formatted files.<br />
We downloaded files for the table HM20 for individual years for the entirety of the panel. The information that we extracted from these tables was the state name and total estimated centerline miles for each state. This information was extracted by way of an R program that can be found in Appendix A. The following link will bring the reader to the page where they can select which year entry of the <em>Highway Statistics Series</em> that they wish to view. The data for centerline miles was captured in the column variable CLM in our dataset.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics.cfm" class="uri">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics.cfm</a></p>
<h3 id="lane-miles">Lane miles</h3>
<p>Lane miles is the measure the number of miles of lanes that a roadway possesses. To exemplify this take a one mile stretch of a four lane roadway the number of lane miles that this stretch would contribute to the states sum is four lane miles. This data was again collected from the Federal Highway Administration’s <em>Highway Statistics Series</em>. The table that we collected this data from was the HM60 table.<br />
We downloaded files for the table HM60 for individual years for the entirety of the panel. The information that we extracted from these tables was the state name and total estimated lane miles for each state. This information was extracted by way of an R program that can be found in Appendix A. The following link will bring the reader to the page where they can select which year entry of the <em>Highway Statistics Series</em> that they wish to view. The data for lane miles was captured in the column variable LM in our dataset.<br />
<a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics.cfm" class="uri">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics.cfm</a></p>
<h3 id="vehicle-miles-traveled">Vehicle Miles Traveled</h3>
<p>Vehicles miles traveled is the estimate of the number of miles that were driven in a given year on the public roadways of a given state. This data was collected from the Federal Highway Administration’s <em>Highway Statistics Series</em>. The table that we collected this data from was the VM2table.<br />
We downloaded files for the table VM2 for individual years for the entirety of the panel. The information we extracted from these tables was the state names and the total estimated number of vehicle miles traveled (In thousands of miles). This information was extracted by way of an R program that can be found in Appendix A. The following link will bring the reader to the page where they can select which ear entry of the <em>Highway Statistics Series</em> that they wish to view. The data for vehicle miles traveled was captured in the column variable VMT in our dataset.<br />
<a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics.cfm" class="uri">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics.cfm</a></p>
<h3 id="notes-on-roadway-estimates">Notes on Roadway Estimates</h3>
<p>We would like to note that special care was taken to ensure that the data that we collected was taken from internally consistent tables. We made sure that the estimates were in the same unit and were estimated using the same bases. Something else that we would like to note is that beginning in the year 2009 the three tables HM20, HM60, and VM2 all contained two extra column variables. This caused our R programs to collect the incorrect column initially. We fixed this mistake by deleting the two extra columns that were included. We chose to delete the two columns for two reasons. The first reason is that the two new columns did not add any new data that we wanted to collect. This leads us to our second reason which is it was easier to just delete these two columns for these files than it was to rewrite our R programs to collect the correct column data.</p>
<h2 id="liberalization-indicators">Liberalization Indicators</h2>
<p>It is difficult to measure the attitudes of individuals towards a particular concept. What we are trying to do in this study is to measure the attitude of the population of individual states towards the use of medical marijuana. To do this we will collect variables that we believe are the direct result of more permissive attitudes towards the use of medical marijuana. What we will use as a source for these the indicator variables is the various Medical Marijuana Laws and if present laws that permit the use of recreational marijuana. We will identify a set of clauses that are included in the Medical Marijuana and Recreational Marijuana Laws as the indicator variables. We will detail the clauses in the following sections as well as a brief justification on why we believe that they are indicators of a more permissive attitude towards the use of medical marijuana. All of the following variables are encoded as binary variables that when a state has this variable we believe it to indicate a more permissive attitude towards the use of medical marijuana.</p>
<h3 id="recreational-marijuana">Recreational Marijuana</h3>
<p>We will begin with what we believe to be the variable that is indicative of the most permissive attitude towards the use of medical marijuana. This factor is the adoption of a law that allows for the possession and consumption of marijuana for recreational use. The first two states to adopt recreational marijuana laws Colorado and Washington did so in the year 2012. Following Colorado and Washington, recreational marijuana laws were adopted by Oregon, Alaska, and Washington D. C. in the year 2014. Since we are collecting data for the years 1996 -2014 this leaves us with little data for this particular variable in our data.</p>
<h3 id="chronic-pain">Chronic Pain</h3>
<p>In the previous chapter we discussed some of the ailments that marijuana has been shown to be a viable therapeutic remedy for. Looking through the composition of the various state Medical Marijuana Laws we find that there is a list of medical conditions that patients with any of these conditions would be made eligible to be recommended medical marijuana. Normally it is the case that the list of conditions that marijuana has been shown to be a viable remedy for and the list of conditions provided for in the Medical Marijuana Law overlap. That is to say that many of the Medical Marijuana Laws seem to be motivated by scientific research to determine which ailments to include, but their is one condition that some states have included that is not a very well defined condition. The condition that we are referring to is chronic pain. Pain is very subjective topic and as such is difficult to disprove. For this variable we will track which states have include in their list of conditions some variation of the phrase Chronic Pain.</p>
<h3 id="voluntary-registration">Voluntary Registration</h3>
<p>The next variable that we collected was whether the state requires those who use medical marijuana to register with the state. We included this because states that do not require their medical marijuana users to register allow for relative anonymity for those who use medical marijuana. The real difference between states with this clause though is that it prevents medical marijuana users from being jailed for possessing marijuana without carrying their registry card.</p>
<h3 id="smokable-marijuana">Smokable Marijuana</h3>
<p>The most common way that marijuana is consumed is as a cigarette that is smoked. We states that do not prohibit medical marijuana users from consuming their medical marijuana in this manner are more permissive than states that only allow for the use of specific forms or derivatives of medical marijuana.</p>
<h3 id="home-cultivation">Home Cultivation</h3>
<p>These clauses allow patients to grow their own supply of medical marijuana at home. These clauses normally specify the number of cannabis plants that the patient is allowed to grow for their personal use. We could have chosen to include this variable as continuous based on the number of plants that patients were allowed to grow. We chose not to do this for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that there is no uniformity in the definition of a cannabis plant. Some states set a limit for the number of both immature and mature. Of the states that differentiate between the number of immature and mature plants there is no consistent definition of the difference of these two categories. The second reason that we chose not to include this variable as a continuous variable is that it not clear that the number of plants is strictly enforced in the states. That is we have not found sufficient evidence to say that the number of plants that a patient grows is tracked in these states.</p>
<h3 id="care-givers">Care Givers</h3>
<p>In some states medical marijuana patients are allowed to designate another individual as a caregiver. In these states caregivers are allowed to grow or procure medical marijuana for the patient. The number of patients that a caregiver can provide care for is usually set and the and strictly enforced. Caregivers are also typically prevented from accepting any form of renumeration for the care that they provide for their patients.</p>
<h3 id="reciprocation">Reciprocation</h3>
<p>Some states have included in their Medical Marijuana Law a clause that allows medical marijuana patients from another state to procure and consume medical marijuana in their state for a temporary period of time.</p>
<h3 id="free-registration">Free Registration</h3>
<p>The fees associated with registering as a medical marijuana patient are assessed to offset the cost to the state of maintaining the patient registry. Due to the cost of the fee that some states charge, we do not believe this to always be the case. To prevent some individuals that would misuse medical marijuana some states have set a fee to register as a medical marijuana patient. Many times these are annual fees that patients have to pay to be eligible to use medical marijuana. In this variable we record which states do not charge patients a fee to register to use medical marijuana. Registration provides patients with a legal defense against being arrested for possession of certain amounts of marijuana provided they have on their person their registry card.</p>
<h3 id="registration-assistance">Registration Assistance</h3>
<p>This variable is similar to the one above except that instead we are recording which states have provisions for the reduction of the fees to register as a medical marijuana patient for patients based on their income level.</p>
<h2 id="climate-conditions">Climate Conditions</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier some of the factors that we believe contribute to the number of fatalities due to car accidents are due to the climate of a region. There are many different factors that we could collect here but we have chosen to collect a small subset of these due to complexity of the variables that we could collect and the methods to collect them. It should be noted that since we are looking at the state level we may loose some of the explanatory power of these climatological factors for states that encompass multiple distinct climates types within their boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="precipitation">Precipitation</h3>
<p>What we collected was the average precipitation for a given state. This was not year specific was the average over the period 1970 - 2010. There is no differentiation between the various forms of precipitation. While we believe that there may be some forms of precipitation that present a higher risk for drivers to drive through, but there was reasonable way to perform this differentiation. There is also no clear transformation between the different forms of precipitation. This variable is measured in inches of precipitation. The variable assigned is constant for a state across the entire panel.</p>
<h3 id="average-temperature">Average Temperature</h3>
<p>We attempted to rectify the lack of a way to differentiate between the types of precipitation by collecting the average yearly temperature for each state. The data that we collected was the average yearly temperature for the period 1970 - 2010. This is the average of the daily high temperatures for a year for the years 1970 - 2010. We are hoping to be able to interact the Average Temperature with the number of inches of precipitation that a state receives to try and tease out of it a way to account for the different types of precipitation.</p>
<h1 id="exploratory-analysis">Exploratory Analysis</h1>
<h2 id="initial-analysis">Initial Analysis</h2>
<p>Before we we attempt to create a model to determine if there is a causal relationship between the legalization of marijuana for medical use and the number of fatalities due to car accidents, we take a closer look at the data that we collected in an attempt to better understand what variables we could logically include in our data. In particular we wish to take a closer at two important factors.<br />
First, we wish to look at the relative danger experienced by drivers in a particular state. What we wish to determine is to see which states are already more dangerous to drive in. There are many potential confounding variables for this particular measure, but we believe that we can determine with a handful of variables the main contributors to the relative danger of driving in a given state.<br />
The second factor that we wish to examine closer is the relative looseness of attitude towards the use of medical marijuana for particular states. For this we will look at states that have implemented a medical marijuana law. In the data set that we collected we created a set of categorical variables for the states that have a medical marijuana law. These categorical variables were created based on particular things mentioned in the medical marijuana law passed by that state. We will cover in more detail the particular variables that we chose to represent the relative looseness in attitude towards the use of medical marijuana. We will assume for this purpose that states that have not legalized the use of medical marijuana are all the same in their attitude towards the use of medical marijuana.</p>
<h3 id="relative-danger-involved-with-driving">Relative Danger Involved with Driving</h3>
<p>What we want to look at in this section is ways to describe the relative danger associated with the act of driving a motor vehicle when driving in a particular state.There is a very large set of potential variables that can affect the relative danger metric that we wish to describe. One of the potential variables that could affect our danger metric is the local climate type. Looking in particular at states that receive a higher than average level of precipitation, it can be argued that wet or snowy roads are more dangerous to traverse than dry roads. We could also look at the terrain that the roads carve their way across. The grade or slope of a road could also used to describe the relative danger involved with driving on that road. These would be difficult variables to track though, due to the diverse geography of the United States there are many different environmental or terrain factors that are endemic to certain portions of the country and can differ even within state. There would be no feasible way to classify the type of terrain or environmental factors that drivers could experience while driving in a particular state. The type of variable that we are looking to use in our danger metric are ones that can be feasibly collected for every state.</p>
<h3 id="number-of-fatalities">Number of Fatalities </h3>

<p>Looking at the map of the number of fatal car accidents by state it appears that the trio of California, Texas, and Florida are the most dangerous states to drive in. Looking at their ranking in the number of fatal accidents through the period that we selected for our panel data the three of these states are consistently the top three states for the number of fatal accidents. While it may appear that these three states are the most deadly to operate a motor vehicle in it may not be the case that they in fact are. The number of car accident fatalities may have been skewed by a number of different variables. While we may not be able to describe the entire effect reason that these three states consistently experience the highest number of fatalities due to car accidents, we believe that they following variables describe a large enough amount of the reason.<br />
First off, the three of these states are among the most populated states as well. This is to say, the larger the population of the state the larger the driving population of that state. While this may not be the case in densely populated states with better access to public transportation, we will try to combine with other factors to show that this is the case in the trio of California, Texas, and Florida.<br />
The second variable that is potentially skewing these number is that these states are among the top in Vehicle Miles Travelled(VMT).VMT estimates the number of miles driven within a given state. While this variable may not necessarily tell us about the duration of each trip that a driver takes, it does indicate that there is for sure more driving going in on that state.<br />
Lastly the trio of California, Texas, and Florida are among the top states for lane miles. Lane miles is the estimate of the number of miles of lanes in a given state. In this metric lanes are counted almost as individual roads and the number of miles is summed among the totality of lanes. To illustrate this take a road that runs for 10 miles with four lanes, the number of lane miles that this road contributes to the state total would then be 40 lane miles. The more lanes there are in a road the more potential cars that that road can accommodate at any given time. For example, a four lane highway should have roughly double the traffic capacity of a two lane road. This extra capacity increases the probability that drivers will interact with one another.<br />
Combine all of the effect of all of the variables we just described and we can see the need for a way to normalize the data so that outliers do not so heavily weight the results of our analysis.</p>
<h3 id="fatalities-per-capita">Fatalities per Capita</h3>
<p>As we described in the previous section looking only at the the number of fatalities from car accidents may not be the best measure to use when determining the risk involved with operating a motor vehicle in a given state. We then created an alternative metric by which to judge the relative danger of associated with driving in any given state. Looking at the results for the fatalities per capita we see a much closer spread in the distribution of this variable. This may be something worth noting for when we go to create our model. Because this transforms the values for the individual states into a much closer spread it reduces the effect that outlier states with high traffic accident fatalities and high population it may be a prudent choice of variable to regress on.<br />
All of the various measures that we have looked in this section make us believe that for our model we may need to create a single measure to encompass the risk associated with driving in that state. There are multiple variables that we could include in the creation of such a measure. We will investigate the creation of this measure further on in our study.</p>
<h3 id="the-propagation-of-medical-marijuana-laws">The Propagation of Medical Marijuana Laws</h3>
<p><span>r</span><span>.5</span></p>
<p>We will now look at the spread of Medical Marijuana Laws through the course of our panel data. Looking at the graphic to the right we can see that once a state has adopted a Medical Marijuana Law its neighbors seem more likely to adopt one as well. It would be interesting to see if this pattern held if a state like Florida were to adopt a Medical Marijuana Law. The Southeast and Midwestern portions of the United States seem to be less permissive towards the use of medical marijuana based on the spread we see in the graphic. It is worth noting that many of the states in these regions have adopted laws allowing for the medical use of high CBD minimal THC strains of marijuana. The proportion of THC that these strains are allowed to contain is basically non-existent (0.25% or less).</p>
<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>With our initial analysis done we will take what we learned through our exploration of the data and try to create a reasonable model using the data that we collected.</p>
<h1 id="the-model">The Model</h1>
<p>In our investigation to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the number of fatalities due to car accidents and the advent of a Medical Marijuana Law so far we have examined the existing research and collected data for the purpose of creating a model. Now we move on to the main portion of our original work, the creation of a model. We will use the data that we have cleaned and collected to try and determine if we can create a model that describes the interaction between the number of fatalities due to car accidents and Medical Marijuana Laws.<br />
It should be obvious to the reader that no states have the exact same risk involved with driving in that state. This risk changes according to a variety of different factors. The factors that could be used to describe why states vary in the number and rate of fatal accidents are too numerous to even attempt to collect or analyze. What we hope to accomplish with our model is to explain the reason for the variance in the number and rate of fatalities due to car accidents with a reasonable number of variables. To accomplish this we we will attempt to use a few techniques available to us.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="liberalization-factors">Liberalization Factors</h2>
<p>For the model that we are creating we wish to be able to include the effect that the implementation of a Medical Marijuana Law would have on the number and rate of fatalities due to traffic accidents. The assumption that we will work off of in this section is that states with a more permissive attitude towards the use of Medical Marijuana will allow its citizens more or easier access to Medical Marijuana. It is this increase in the ease of access to the use of marijuana that could lead to an increase in the number of drivers who will drive while under the influence of marijuana. We have collected a number of variables that we believe can be used to describe the permissiveness of a state towards the use of Medical Marijuana, but there is a good possibility that a states permissiveness may be described using a subset of this variables.<br />
First we will take the already list of factors that we collected from the various state Medical Marijuana Laws and try to reduce it even further. To accomplish this reduction in dimensionality we will apply the techniques of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis(FA) From there we will compare the results of the two techniques to determine if there is a viable subset of the variables. The last technique that we will attempt is the creation of some Indexes as an alternative technique to both FA and PCA.</p>
<h3 id="factor-analysis">Factor Analysis</h3>
<p>Factor Analysis is a technique that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of data sets that are to be used for predictive modeling. With the method we are trying to predict some underlying factor using as view observed variables to describe it. This is exactly what we would like to be able to do with the variables that we collected from the various state Medical Marijuana Laws. We would like to use the variables that we observed from the laws to describe the liberalization of a given state with respect to the use of Medical Marijuana. What we wish to describe is an unobserved variable using the observed variables from the set of Medical Marijuana Laws.<br />
What we will first try to understand the number of underlying factors that are present in the variables that we have collected in to describe the permissiveness towards medical marijuana. To do this we will look at the Scree plot of the data and apply two common heuristics to determine a reasonable number of factors. A Scree plot is a plot where the Y- Axis is the eigenvalues associated with individual factors and the X- Axis represents the index of the factors in descending eigenvalues.</p>
<p>The two heuristics that we will apply to the Scree Plot above are the Kaiser-Guttman and the Cattell rules. The Kaiser-Guttman rule tells us to drop all factors that have an eigenvalue less than one. The reason to drop factors with eigenvalues less than one is that these factors have less explanatory power than one variable. The Cattell rule is less rigorous than the Kaiser-Guttman rule and allows the researcher some leeway on the choice of the number of factors to include. The application of Cattell rule is to pick an “elbow” where the eigenvalue of all proceeding variables tends to flatten out. That is the pick a spot where the slope of the Scree plot appears to be approaching zero. Applying both of these rules to the above Scree Plot we see that we end up choosing the our number of factors to be three.<br />
Three represents a reasonable reduction in the dimensionality of our variable space, but since we believe that the variables that we collected from the Medical Marijuana Laws describe the latent factor of permissiveness of attitude towards the use of medical marijuana we will see if we can reduce the dimensionality even further.</p>
<h3 id="principle-component-analysis">Principle Component Analysis</h3>
<p>Principle Component Analysis(PCA), just like Factor Analysis is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a set of variables. PCA takes makes use of the idea from Linear Algebra of a Basis for vector spaces. That is a that we can compose a set of vectors such that all other vectors in the given vector space can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors. With PCA the basis that we hope to find will also by construction be orthogonal, this way it minimizes the covariance among the basis vectors.<br />
Taking the factor variables that we have collected we will attempt to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the Liberalization variable. looking at the correlation matrix for the factor variables (Table 1) we see that some of the variables are highly correlated. Notice that the SmokableSupply variable is highly correlated with the variables ChronicPain, HomeCultivation, and Caregivers. This makes us think that applying PCA may prove to be beneficial for a reduction in dimensionality.</p>

<p>We will now apply the PCA technique to our set of variables that describe the permissiveness of states with respect to the use of Medical Marijuana. Since we are using R as our primary means of analysis for this study it is worth noting that there are two methods that the function princomp can use to calculate the PCA. Either it can use the correlation matrix or the covariance matrix to calculate the amount of variance described the different variables. We will perform the PCA technique using both ways to calculate the amount of variance that is explained for each variable and then compare the two. This will hopefully give us insight into which of the variables that are potentially explained as a linear combination of the others. We will first perform the calculation using the correlation matrix.</p>
<p>In the above figure we can see that the amount of variance that is explained by the first component is significantly larger than the proceeding variables but that there is not another significant decrease. What we were hoping to see with in this calculation was more of the variance explained by a fewer number of variables than what we see. Going off of this calculation we could only justify reducing the dimensionality by about three. This is not an insignificant reduction but it still not an ideal number of variables to deal with. We would like to be able to reduce this number even further if possible.<br />
Continuing on with our application of the PCA technique we will now compute the variance explained by each variable using the covariance matrix. It is more common to use the covariance matrix for PCA than with the correlation matrix. The reason that one might use the correlation matrix to in the PCA calculation is as a way to standardize the set of variables if the variables are in disparate units of measurement. Since our variables are all binary categorical variables there are no units for us to worry about in the calculation. We are hoping that using the covariance matrix leads to a larger reduction in the dimensionality of our set of variables.</p>
<p>The first thing that we can notice about the graph above is that the initial drop in the variance is much more significant than that from the correlation calculation. But just as is the case with the variables from the correlation calculations the proceeding variables for the covariance calculation add very little to the cumulative variance. Upon closer inspection we can see that after about the fourth variable very little is being added to the cumulative variance. We are able to conclude from the covariance matrix that we could reasonably reduce the dimensionality of the variables by five. That is we can reduce the initial nine variables to the first four variables without loosing too much explanatory power.<br />
Having examined the results of the Factor Analysis and both versions of the Principle Component Analysis we can say that we have good reason to believe that there is a reasonable reduction in the dimensionality of the permissiveness variables. But is still not entirely clear how this reduction should be performed, so we will attempt one last technique to consolidate the variables even further.</p>
<h3 id="liberalization-index">Liberalization Index</h3>
<p>Optimally we would like to have a single value that we can use in our model to describe the permissiveness of states towards the use of medical marijuana. We have so far tried to accomplish this using both Factor Analysis and Principle Component Analysis. These techniques gave us somewhat favorable results but we believe that there may still be a way to reduce the dimensionality of our variables to a single predictor variable that we can use for our model. To accomplish this we will attempt to create an index that combines the effects of the variables into this single value. There are three different potential indexes for us to use and we will detail all three of these indexes including their creation and viability for use in our model.</p>
<h4 id="naive-index">Naive Index</h4>
<p>In our first attempt to create an index we will try the most simple technique at our disposal. The technique that we will use is just a straight sum of the nine different variables that collected from state Medical Marijuana Laws. We calculated this sum for every entry in the panel with the resulting variable being named Sum. The calculation for the new Sum variable was as follows.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
Sum = &amp;  \ Recreational + ChronicPain + VoluntaryRegistration + SmokableSupply \\ 
		   &amp; + HomeCultivation   + Caregivers + OutofStateIDs + RegistrationFree  \\
		   &amp;+ AssistanceProgram 
\end{aligned}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>This new variable accomplishes what we set out to do. It reduces the variables down into a single value that we can use in the creation of a model. There are however some considerations that we need to keep in mind with respect to how this sum handles the variables that contribute to its creation. This new Sum variable weights each of its constituent variables equally. As we saw from the results of our Factor Analysis and Principle Component Analysis results it is not likely that each of these variables contribute in a one-to-one fashion to describe the permissiveness of a state towards medical marijuana. It is likely the case that some of these variables are just linear combinations of the others and by weighting them equally we are overestimating the effect of certain variables to our Liberalization Index. We will attempt to rectify this by creating a way to weight the variables so as to increase the difference in the amount that variables contribute our Liberalization Index.</p>
<h4 id="weighted-index">Weighted Index</h4>
<p>What the previous naive index was lacking was a way to differentiate between the contribution of different variables to the index. When looking at the variables that we collected from the state Medical Marijuana Laws it becomes clear that there are some clauses that are much more prevalent and there are clauses that a smaller subset of states have included. It is this difference in the prevalence of different clauses that we wish to highlight in our Liberalization Index. What we will do is create a weighting for each of the constituent variables and then sum these newly weighted variables to create our Liberalization Index. For the weighting we are proposing the use of the proportion of the total number of entries for a variable across the panel that each entry adds. We will then take these weighted entries for each state and sum them to create our Liberalization Index. We will name this variable LiberalizationA. In mathematical terms LiberalizationA looks like the following.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\rho_w = \sum_{i = entry}{} \frac{1}{Variable_i}$$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>L</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>z</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>A</em> = ∑<sub><em>j</em> = <em>v</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>a</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>e</em></sub>(<em>ρ</em><sub><em>w</em></sub>)<sub><em>j</em></sub></span><br /></p>
<p>Looking at the results of the calculations for LiberalizationA we see that most of the weightings for the constituent variables are very small numbers. This makes the LiberalizationA entry for each of the states with non-zero entries a relatively small number. It may be the case that we are now underestimating the effect of the variables on the Liberalization Index. We will keep the LiberalizationA variable for potential use in our model, but we will create some other potential weightings for our Liberalization Index.</p>
<h4 id="weighted-index-2">Weighted Index 2</h4>
<p>With our simple weighting from the previous step we see that we may run into some issues with the size of the numbers that we obtained. With this weighting we hope to rectify the discrepancy in the size of the number that is assigned so that it is a more reasonably sized number. To this we will implement a much more complex weighting transformation. For this new weighting we will take the sum of entries for each variable and divide it by the sum of entries across all variables this is the proportion of the total number of entries that a variable contributes. We will assign this to the variable <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em><sub><em>u</em><em>w</em></sub></span>. We will then divide one by the square root of the proportion that we found in the previous step for each variable. This will be the weighting factor for the Liberalization Index and we will as it the variable <span class="math inline"><em>w</em><em>f</em></span>. The last step in the transformation is to take the weighting for each variable and divide it by the sum of the weighting factors for the variables, this creates a weighted proportion for each of the variables which we will assign to the variable <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em><sub><em>w</em></sub></span>. We will then use the sum of the weighted proportion of the variables to create our Liberalization Index which we will denote as LiberalizationB in our dataset.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\rho_{uw} = \frac{\mathop{\sum\limits_{i=entry}{}} x_i}{\mathop{\sum\limits_{j = variable}{} \sum\limits_{i = entry}{}} x_{ij}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$wf = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{j = state}{}\sum\limits_{i=entry}{} x_{ij}}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\rho_w = \frac{wf}{{\sum\limits_{j = variable}{}wf_j}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$LiberalizationB = \sum\limits_{j = variable}{} (\rho_w)_j$$</span><br /></p>
<p>Looking at the results of the calculations for LiberalizationB we see a much more reasonable weight being assigned to each of the variables with the sums being much more reasonable as well. Looking closer though and we see that a fairly large spread in the weights for the variables with the largest value being assigned to Recreational (0.293) and the smallest value being assigned to SmokableSupply (0.050). We will add this to our original weighting as a variable to test the use of in our model.</p>
<h4 id="weighted-index-3">Weighted Index 3</h4>
<p>We will attempt one last method to weight the variables for use in our Liberalization Index. This time we will use a slightly different transformation to weight the variables. What we will do this time is to take the probabilistic compliment of the proportion found in our previous weighting attempt for each variable and assign that the intermediary variable <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>. We will then take the sum of all of the compliments and divide each of the compliments to find the proportion of the sum that each compliment adds. We will denote this proportion as <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em><sub><em>c</em><em>w</em></sub></span>. The final step in our weighting would then be to take sum of the newly weighted variables for each state. This we will denote as LiberalizationC in our dataset.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$c = 1 - \frac{\mathop{\sum\limits_{i=entry}{}} x_i}{\mathop{\sum\limits_{j = variable}{} \sum\limits_{i = entry}{}} x_{ij}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\rho_{cw} = \frac{c}{\sum\limits_{j = variable}{}c_j}$$</span><br /></p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$LiberalizationC = \sum\limits_{j= variable}(\rho_{cw})_j$$</span><br /></p>
<p>With this weighting we see that the variables maintain the rank from the previous weighting but with a much smaller spread in the individual weightings. The maximum weighting has again been assigned to the variable Recreational (0.124) with the minimum weighting being assigned to the variable SmokableSupply (0.096). We have pretty much exhausted the possibilities for reducing the dimension of the variables that describe the permissiveness in attitude with respect to the use of medical marijuana. We are satisfied with the three Liberalization Indexes. We believe that we will find one of them to be sufficient to describe the effect that liberalization would have on fatalities due to car accidents. When we are working on creating the model later in this section we will compare the three weightings and decide then which of the three to use. For now we will move on to discussing the other variables that we will use in the creation of our model.</p>
<h2 id="riskiness-index">Riskiness Index</h2>
<p>Just as we did with the permissiveness variables we will now attempt to create a way to reduce the dimensionality of our variables pertaining to the inherent risk associated with driving in each state. We will first focus on the creation of an index that describes the inherent risk due to distribution of the population into age groups. We would like to discuss here our choice to not attempt either Factor Analysis or Principle Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality.<br />
What we had before with the permissiveness variables was a set of variables that were logically similar. We could argue that what we were trying to describe was some underlying factor related to the permissiveness that we described as a liberalized attitude towards the use of medical marijuana. We were able to argue that each of the clauses that we collected as variables were in some way indicative of this liberalized attitude so that it was possible to describe the effect of some of the variables as a combination of the other variables. We do not believe that this is the case with the variables that we collected regarding inherent risk due to population distribution by age that these are linear combinations of one another. That is we do not see a clear link between the involvement rate in fatal accidents of the different age groups to be dependent on one another. We believe that to accomplish a reduction in the dimensionality of these variables will require us to create an index that relates these disparate age groups together.<br />
To reduce the dimensionality with respect to the riskiness inherent to each state with respect to the population distribution by age group we will create an index that will assign a value to each state based on the fatal accident involvement rate of different age groups. As we found from the FARS data byway of the IIHS different age groups have differing rates of involvement in fatal car accidents. Looking at the estimated population by age for each state from the US Census it is apparent that states are not uniform in the size of their population that belongs in the age groups defined in the IIHS fatal crash involvement rate. The index that we will create will transform the variables to reduce the dimensionality so that when we construct our model we have a reasonable number of variables without loosing explanatory power.<br />
To create our Riskiness Index we will use the data that we have for the involvement rate in fatal accidents by age group and the population estimates for these age groups and transform them so that they provide a single value for us to use in our model. What we want to determine is which states are riskier to drive in due to the distribution of their population. To do this we will need to set a standard for us to compare the relative riskiness of the individual states. What we will use as our baseline in this case is the national average. We will compare each state to the sum of all states. We will look at the ratio of the states riskiness to the national riskiness to determine which states are riskier and which states are safer. We will detail the how we create the Riskiness Index in steps. This is so that we can describe in the clearest way possible to reader as we believe that this one of the most important pieces in the creation of our model.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\alpha_{i} = \sum\limits_{a = Age Group}{}\frac{n_{ia}}{\sum\limits_{a = Age Group}{}n_{ia}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>The alpha here represents the proportion of a states population belongs to a given age group.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\alpha_{a}^{n} = \sum\limits_{a = Age Group}{}\frac{n_{na}}{\sum\limits_{a = Age Group}{}n_{na}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>The alpha in this equation represents the proportion of the national population that belongs in a given age group.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\sum\limits_{a = Age Group}{}\frac{f_a}{\sum\limits_{j = State}{}n_{ja}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>This sum represents the rate of involvement in fatal car accidents per capita for a given age group. We will now combine the three of these terms to create the final transformation that we ar e going to use for our Riskiness Index.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$RiskinessIndex = \frac{\sum\limits_{a = Age Group}{} \alpha_{a} \frac{f_a}{\sum\limits_{j =state}{}{n_{ja}}}}{\sum\limits_{a = Age Group}{} \alpha_{a
	}^{n} \frac{f_a}{\sum\limits_{j =state}{}{n_{ja}}}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>Breaking down what we are calculating with the Riskiness Index in the numerator of the equation we are taking the sum of the expected number of fatal accidents that the specified age groups will be involved in. On the denominator we are calculating the same thing but instead of looking at a particular state we are looking at the national average for our riskiness measure. Taking the equation as a whole we are looking at the ratio of a states riskiness to the national average. The values that will be assigned should vary slightly from a number slightly less than one to slightly greater than one. Looking at the results of the calculation we see that this is the case, all of the enrties have been assigned a value ranging from slightly less than one to slightly greater than one.<br />
We feel confident in adding our Riskiness Index to the list of variables to use in creation of our model. We will determine if this variable ends up being a explanatory variable or part of the dependent variable in our regression analysis.</p>
<h2 id="vehicle-miles-traveled-per-capita">Vehicle Miles Traveled per Capita</h2>
<p>We are almost finished describing the variables that need to be transformed before we include them in the model. The last one that we will discuss is the simplest of the bunch, but still needs some description to justify its inclusion in the model. The last variable that we will discuss is the Vehicle Miles Travled per Capita. This one is a simple calculation but the units that it is in make it is not neccesarily intuitive. The calculation for the variable is the following.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$vmtpc = \frac{VMT}{POP}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>What we like to make note of is that this number is proportion of one million miles per capita which results in numbers that may not make sense if one was to look at them.</p>
<h2 id="creation-of-the-model">Creation of the Model</h2>
<p>We are now at the point were we can start creating models to test whether there exists a causal relationship between the advent of Medical Marijuana Law and the rate of fatalities due to car accidents. We will work our way through potential models starting with the most basic model and increasing the complexity as needed. The first of our models will include what we believe to be the bare minimum number of variables that we believe could determine the effect that Medical Marijuana Laws have on the rate of fatalities due to car accidents.<br />
We should also mention that for all of the models that we create we will be using the natural log of all none binary variables. We are using this transformation so as to minimize the effect of outliers to the regression while retaining a regression constant that is interpretable.</p>
<h3 id="liberalization-index-selection">Liberalization Index Selection</h3>
<p>Before we begin with our model creation in earnest though we need to determine which of our potential Liberalization Indexes we want to use. To determine this we will take the set of variables that we wish to use for our initial model and look at its correlation matrix. By looking at the correlation matrix we hope to find how the three potential indexes interact with the other variables.</p>

<p>In the correlation above we can see that all three of the possible Liberalization Indexes have roughly the same correlation to the other variables. Since this is this case there is no disadvantage to the selection of any of the three based on how the interact with the other variables. We will select the Liberalization Index that we believe will give us the most interpretable results when used in the model. We believe that LiberalC is the index that will have the most interpretable results.</p>
<h3 id="first-model">First Model</h3>
<p>As was mentioned at the beginning of this section the models that we create will begin out as we can justify making them and then increase in complexity as needed. For our first model we will include the following variables: vmtpc, stateriskiness, LiberalC, and seatbelt to predict the rate of fatal car accident fatalities. Our first model that we will run is the following. <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
ln(fatalpc)  &amp;= \beta_1 ln(vmtpc) + \beta _{2} ln(stateriskiness) + \beta_3 LiberalC \\

<p>Looking at the results of the first model (Table 4.4) we see that most of the results fall in line with what we were expecting to see. For the variables lnvmtpc, LiberalC, and seatbelt the the sign of the coefficients is what we initially hypothesized. Is interesting that the sign of the coefficient for the stateriskiness variable ended up the opposite of what we thought it should be. Not only is the sign opposite of what we hypothesized the variable itself is very much not statistically significant. There is no reasonable level of significance that we could use that would change that fact. One reason that we could end up with a result like this is that the variable should be apart of the dependent variable. How we will attempt to correct this is to move the variable to the other side of the equation so that the left-hand side of the equation looks like the following. <br /><span class="math display"><em>l</em><em>n</em>(<em>f</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>c</em>)−<em>l</em><em>n</em>(<em>s</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>k</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em>s</em>)</span><br /> Using log rules to simplify the equation we get the following result which we will rename adjfatalpc and then take the natural log of the new variable.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$ln(adjfatalpc) = ln({\frac{fatalpc}{stateriskiness}})$$</span><br /></p>
<p>What this new variable does is to weight the fatality rate by the Riskiness Index. We will test out our new variable in our second model that we run.</p>
<h3 id="second-model">Second Model</h3>
<p>For our second model we will take the variable that we created and regress it on the set of variables that we used in the previous model. We will reuse the variables from the previous model because there was nothing in the results that made us believe that they were not valid choices. Our new model is the following.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>l</em><em>n</em>(<em>a</em><em>d</em><em>j</em><em>f</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>c</em>)=<em>β</em><sub>1</sub><em>l</em><em>n</em>(<em>v</em><em>m</em><em>t</em><em>p</em><em>c</em>)+<em>β</em><sub>2</sub><em>L</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>C</em> + <em>β</em><sub>3</sub><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>b</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>t</em> + <em>ϵ</em></span><br /></p>

<p>Looking at the results for our second model (Table 4.5) we see mush of the same pattern that we saw in the results of our first model. We that all of these variables have the sign that we thought that they should have and all of the variables are statistically significant within standard levels of significance. We are very intrigued by this model. We believe that this model may be sufficient for our purposes. We will investigate further whether we can rely on the results of this model.</p>
<h3 id="third-model">Third Model</h3>
<p>Bolstered buy the results from the previous model we will try to validate the model with the data that we have. In our third model we will include year and state specific indicator variables. We are using this in lieu of variables to control for safety improvements. The equation for the model is as follows.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}

<p>Ignoring the intercept, in these results we see that the three variables once again maintain their sign from the previous models. Two of them have now lost their statistical significance, but we are not that concerned with this. We are not overly concerned with the results of the last since what we were trying to test was whether we could make the variables to behave inconsistently. In the next chapter we will discuss further the results of the models that we created in this section.</p>
<h1 id="discussion-of-results">Discussion of Results</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will discuss the results from models that we ran in the previous chapter. We will try to reason our way through the models to determine what type of relationships were revealed. Overall we were happy with the results that we got from our model variations.</p>
<h2 id="vmt-per-capita">VMT per Capita</h2>
<p>In the four variations of the model that we ran we saw that this variable behaves consistently as we thought that it would. It makes sense that the more the population of a state drives on average that we can expect more car accident fatalities on average. It would be interesting to see how the implementation of a more robust public transportation system would have on this variable.</p>
<h2 id="primary-seatbelt">Primary Seatbelt</h2>
<p>The primary seatbelt law behaved as we expected it to with a negative impact on the age adjusted rate of fatalities. This falls in line with the spirit of a primary seatbelt law. These laws were designed to increase the number of drivers and passengers that wear seatbelts while a motor vehicle is being operated.</p>
<h2 id="liberalization">Liberalization</h2>
<p>Now to the variable that has been the focus of this study and that is the Liberalization factor. Throughout the variations of the model we saw that the Liberalization variable that we used maintained a negative effect on the age adjusted rate of car accident fatalities. We were a little surprised that it maintained this negative relationship with our dependent variable. What we believe initially was that the Liberalization factor would have no effect on the age adjusted fatality rate. From what we saw in the literature we suspected that because marijuana was a potential substitute for alcohol <span class="citation"></span> that any increase in marijuana consumption would lead to a decrease in alcohol consumption.<br />
Our results from the model are somewhat in line with the results from Anderson et al <span class="citation"></span> with our model attributing a much larger decrease due to the Liberalization Factor. This difference is hard to attribute solely to the Liberalization factor. We believe that there is more that needs to be investigated in this area. It could be that the permissiveness in attitude towards the use of marijuana may itself be just a factor of a state that has more liberalized policies in gerneral.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>Going forward we would like to investigate further the effect that the liberalization of marijuana policy has on society. We are planning on continuing our work on its effect on the rate of traffic fatalities. To do this we would like to collect data for more potential factors that could have an effect on the age adjusted fatality rate. Potential factors to collect include: public transit use rate, alcohol consumption, and other liberalization factors.</p>
